# JustBot

A slackbot that makes sure you really can "just" do something. Whenever anyone
says "just" in a sentence, JustBot asks to make sure you can really "just" do
it.

## Running JustBot

Just set your Slack token as an environment variable named `SLACK_TOKEN` and
then run `mix run --no-halt`.

```
$ SLACK_TOKEN=abc-123 mix run --no-halt
```
